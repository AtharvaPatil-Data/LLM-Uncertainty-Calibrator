## 🔍 Overview

**LLM-Uncertainty-Calibrator** measures and corrects the **miscalibration** of a real financial language model. When a model says it is "95% confident," it should be right about 95% of the time — but neural networks are often overconfident, which is dangerous in financial decision-making where confidence drives downstream risk decisions.

This project uses **FinBERT** (`ProsusAI/finbert`), a transformer already fine-tuned on financial text, and evaluates it on the **Financial PhraseBank** — the standard peer-reviewed benchmark for financial sentiment. We then apply three calibration techniques and measure the improvement with **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**.

**Task:** Financial sentiment classification (negative / neutral / positive) — a core financial NLP task whose calibrated confidence feeds directly into risk assessment.

> **Why a pre-trained model on a real benchmark?** An untrained classifier outputs near-uniform probabilities (≈1/3 per class), which makes "calibration" meaningless. FinBERT produces genuine, varied confidence scores, so calibrating them is a real, defensible exercise.

## ⚠️ The Problem: Overconfident Models

- A model predicting "90% confidence" may only be correct 70% of the time.
- Overconfidence tends to grow with model size and complexity.
- Miscalibrated probabilities mislead any risk system built on top of them.
- **Real-world impact:** an overconfident financial assistant exposes an institution to liability and regulatory risk.

## ✅ Three Calibration Methods

### 1️⃣ Temperature Scaling
Learns a single scalar `T` and rescales logits before softmax: `softmax(logits / T)`. Minimises validation negative log-likelihood. Simple, fast, and usually effective.

### 2️⃣ Platt Scaling
Fits a multinomial logistic regression on validation logits. More flexible than temperature scaling, but can **overfit** on small validation sets — a useful failure mode to observe.

### 3️⃣ Conformal Prediction
Produces **prediction sets** with a distribution-free coverage guarantee: the true label lies in the set with probability ≥ (1−α). Output looks like *"the label is in {neutral, positive} at 90% confidence."*

### Metric: Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
Weighted average gap between confidence and accuracy across bins. `ECE = Σ |acc(bin) − conf(bin)| × (|bin| / N)`. Lower is better; 0 = perfect calibration.

## 📊 Key Results

> Numbers below are produced by `colab_inference.py` and rendered live in the dashboard. Re-running the script regenerates them; fill in your latest run here.

| Metric | Baseline | Temperature Scaling | Platt Scaling |
|--------|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Test Accuracy** | _from run_ | — | — |
| **ECE** | _from run_ | _from run_ | _from run_ |
| **Conformal Coverage** | — | — | **~90% (target 90%)** |
| **Avg Prediction Set Size** | — | — | _from run_ |

### What to look for
- ✅ **Confidence spans a wide range** (≈0.5–1.0), not a flat band around 0.33 — proof the model is actually classifying.
- ✅ **Temperature Scaling reduces ECE** — the headline calibration result.
- ✅ **Platt Scaling may or may not help** — on small validation sets it can overfit and *increase* ECE, which is an honest, instructive finding.
- ✅ **Conformal coverage lands near the 90% target** with **small** prediction sets (mostly 1–2 classes), i.e. the guarantee is non-trivial.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run calibration on Google Colab

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) → **Runtime → Change runtime type → T4 GPU**
2. Upload `colab_inference.py`
3. Install dependencies:
   ```python
   !pip install "transformers>=4.40" torch "datasets>=2.18,<3.0" scikit-learn scipy -q
   ```
4. Run:
   ```python
   !python colab_inference.py
   ```
5. Download results:
   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   files.download("results.json")
   ```

**Runtime:** ~2–5 minutes on a T4.

### 2. Launch the dashboard locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AtharvaPatil-Data/LLM-Uncertainty-Calibrator.git
cd LLM-Uncertainty-Calibrator
pip install streamlit plotly pandas numpy matplotlib
# place the downloaded results.json:
cp /path/to/results.json dashboard/data/
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

Dashboard opens at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🧪 Methodology

### Dataset — Financial PhraseBank
Sentences drawn from financial news, each labelled **negative / neutral / positive** by annotators. We use the `sentences_50agree` subset (≥50% annotator agreement) and evaluate on a stratified sample. This is the benchmark FinBERT was designed for, so accuracy is high and confidence scores are meaningful.

### Label Alignment (important detail)
FinBERT emits classes in **its** order (`positive, negative, neutral`) while the dataset stores them in a **different** order (`negative, neutral, positive`). The script reads both orderings at runtime and remaps the dataset's labels into the model's index space, so probability column *i* always corresponds to true-label *i*. Getting this wrong is the classic bug that makes a working model look random.

### Pipeline
1. Run FinBERT over each sentence, extract raw **logits**.
2. Convert to uncalibrated probabilities via softmax.
3. Learn calibration parameters on the **calibration half** (Temperature `T`, Platt regression, conformal threshold).
4. Apply to the **test half**.
5. Report accuracy, ECE (before/after), conformal coverage and set sizes.

**Split:** 50% calibration / 50% test, stratified.

### Conformal Prediction
1. Non-conformity score on calibration set: `s(x,y) = 1 − P(y | x)`.
2. Threshold `q` at the `⌈(n+1)(1−α)⌉/n` quantile of scores.
3. Include class *i* in the test prediction set if `1 − P(i | x) ≤ q`.

With α = 0.1 this targets **90%** marginal coverage.

## 🎓 PhD Research Connection

Directly supports the **Central Bank of Ireland PhD Programme** — *"Framework for Interpretable and Behavioural Risk Assessment of Intelligent Language Models"*:

- **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty** — calibration turns overconfident scores into trustworthy probabilities for downstream risk decisions.
- **Risk Assessment in Financial Services** — post-hoc calibration corrects miscalibration without retraining.
- **Statistical Rigour & Formal Guarantees** — conformal prediction gives distribution-free coverage guarantees.
- **Interpretability** — reliability diagrams and prediction sets make uncertainty explicit and auditable.
